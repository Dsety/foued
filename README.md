programming DualityEditor
All framework build results will be located in the shared Build/Output folder. Sample project build results will be separate, and located in their respective Content/Plugins subdirectories. To launch any of the included sample projects after building Duality, select it as a startup project in your IDE. Otherwise, you can use either DualityEditor or DualityLauncher as a startup project.
